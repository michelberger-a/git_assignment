# Git Assignment - michelberger-a

a. What is an issue?
An issue can be used to track to do lists, bugs, requests and quite literal "issues" in the code. Issues are structured in which they will appear in list form, making it easy to approach and understand from a problem solving session. Issues can be created and read within GitHub. As mentioned in the lesson, one class participant described an issue, similar to an IT Ticket.  
In an issue, some information is required to be filled out. A title for the issue is needed, and a description. The description will usually contain the checklist and other additional information that deems an issue to be resolved. Alongside this, you can add Assignees - other people/users that can review the work. You can add labels - a way to tag the issue with certain categories. You can add Projects - by assigning the issue to a specific project within the repository. Then there are Milestones - a way to mark progress within an issue and project.  
When you are satisfied with the issue, you can click the green button at the bottom to submit the issue. 

b. What is a pull request?
A pull request is a request used as a potential merging of files from one branch to a destination branch (usually main). The capabilities of pull requests allow teams/users to resolve issues, bugs, or edit the code and save the work in a separate branch, so that the main code is unaffected. Other users/team members can review the code, and once the consensus finds the code is plausible, the branch can be merged into the main branch.  
A pull request has its own tab on the repository page in github. Within each pull request, there are several features to consider. Within each request, you can see the "start" of the request, and the subsequent commits with the summary message(s). Additional features as listed above, Reviewers, Assignees, Labels etc. can be included in the pull request. Although a pull request can be created, it does not mean it has been applied, until the "Merge Pull Requst" button at the end has been clicked. This will allow the merging of the files/code from the branch into the target branch.

c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?
- you fill first need to select a repository of interest and create a branch as a copy of the main branch. This step can be completed through GitHub
- you will need to clone the 
- on GitHub, go to the repository of interest, along the top ribbon of the screen, click into "Pull Requests"
- in the top-right corner, click the green button "New pull request"
- along the top of the new page, under compare changes, from the first drop down menu, select the branch you want to merge files into (typically main) and then in the second drop down menu, select the branch you want to merge files from (typically the branch you've been pushing files too)
- with the origin and destination selected, a module will pop up highlighting changes in files that will be applied with the merge
- if everything is okay, in the top right, click the green box "Create Pull Request"
- a new page will open, you may edit the title, add a description of chnges or info about the request, and additional information and tags such as Reviewers, Assignees, Labels, Projects, Milestones etc. 
- when satisfied, underneath the description box, click the green button "Create pull request"


d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?

f. What does git diff do?

g. What is the main branch?

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
