# Git Assignment - michelberger-a

a. What is an issue?
- an issue can be used to track to do lists, bugs and quite literal "issues" in the code
- they will appear in list form within GitHub
- as mentioned in the lesson, one class participant described an issue, similar to an IT Ticket

b. What is a pull request?
- a pull request is a request used as a potential merging of files from one branch to another (usually main)
- a pull request has its own tab on the repository page in github
- the request will also show a list of changes and comments that are applicable to the merge

c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?
- on GitHub, go to the repository of interest, along the top ribbon of the screen, click into "Pull Requests"
- in the top-right corner, click the green button "New pull request"
- along the top of the new page, under compare changes, from the first drop down menu, select the branch you want to merge files into (typically main) and then in the second drop down menu, select the branch you want to merge files from (typically the branch you've been pushing files too)
- with the origin and destination selected, a module will pop up highlighting changes in files that will be applied with the merge
- if everything is okay, in the top right, click the green box "Create Pull Request"
- a new page will open, you may edit the title, add a description of chnges or info about the request, and additional information and tags such as Reviewers, Assignees, Labels, Projects, Milestones etc. 
- when satisfied, underneath the description box, click the green button "Create pull request"


d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?

f. What does git diff do?
